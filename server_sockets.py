'''
    We provide an exmaple ServerSocket here.
    It is a subclass of threading.Thread, that is,
    it is a threading class.
    You can implement different server sockets with 
    different data analyze methods. Or you use this
    example ServerSocket as the only sockect then
    you need to deal with different type of messages
    in one class.

    We also provide a Meeting class which is used to
    record the meeting information.
    We do not provide any information about the Meeting class,
    so you can design it as you like.
